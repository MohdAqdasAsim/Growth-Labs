PLATFORMS: {platforms}
TIME AVAILABILITY: {time_per_week}

PLATFORM URLS:
- YouTube: {youtube_url}
- Instagram: {instagram_url}
- Reddit: {reddit_url}

COMPETITORS FOR ANALYSIS:
{competitor_urls}

USER'S TOP PERFORMING CONTENT (Auto-classified Top 25%):
YouTube Videos:
{user_best_videos}

Twitter Posts:
{user_best_tweets}

USER'S LOW PERFORMING CONTENT (Auto-classified Bottom 25%):
YouTube Videos:
{user_worst_videos}

Twitter Posts:
{user_worst_tweets}

=== PHASE 2: DEEPER CONTEXT (Optional - may be incomplete) ===
{phase2_data}

=== YOUR TASK ===
Synthesize all available data into a structured creator profile with these 6 components:

1. **creator_identity**: Extract and synthesize:
   - niche (refined understanding of their category)
   - audience (who they serve, demographics if available)
   - unique_angle (what makes them different, infer if not explicit)
   - mission (their content purpose, infer from goals/why they create)

2. **content_dna**: Analyze their content approach:
   - strengths (combine self-reported + inferred from best content)
   - weaknesses (combine self-reported + inferred from worst content)
   - preferred_formats (what they enjoy making + platforms used)
   - avoid (content types to skip based on dislikes + past failures)

3. **performance_insights**: Extract patterns:
   - best_content_pattern (analyze ACTUAL historical content if available, not just self-reported)
   - worst_content_pattern (identify underperforming patterns from historical data)
   - engagement_triggers (what makes their audience respond - use metrics from historical content)
   - content_evolution (how their style has changed over time, if historical data shows trends)

4. **constraints**: Practical limitations:
   - time_capacity (realistic posting frequency based on time available)
   - platforms (which platforms they can handle)
   - tools (what they can technically produce)
   - budget (free vs paid strategies)

5. **growth_context**: Historical learning:
   - past_attempts (what they tried before)
   - what_worked_before (proven tactics for THIS creator)
   - current_metrics (baseline for goal-setting)

6. **strategic_insights**: Future planning guidance:
   - realistic_posting_frequency (calculate from time + platforms)
   - sustainability_risks (burnout factors to watch)
   - authentic_voice (their natural style vs forced)
   - motivation_level (intrinsic vs extrinsic, patient vs desperate)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Base analysis on ACTUAL DATA provided, not assumptions
- If Phase 2 data is missing, infer conservatively from Phase 1
- Mark uncertain inferences clearly ("likely", "appears to", "suggests")
- Be honest about weaknesses - creator needs reality, not flattery
- Focus on ACTIONABLE insights for campaign planning
