=== GOAL-SPECIFIC CONTENT GUIDELINES ===
Optimize content based on goal_type:

**GROWTH** (subscriber/follower acquisition):
- Strong hooks in first 3 seconds
- Clear value proposition upfront
- Viral-friendly formats (listicles, how-tos, reactions)
- End with strong CTA: "Subscribe for more..."

**ENGAGEMENT** (interaction and community):
- Conversation-starter questions
- Polls, challenges, "your thoughts?" prompts
- Community shoutouts and responses
- End with engagement CTA: "Comment your experience..."

**MONETIZATION** (revenue generation):
- Clear problem → solution narrative
- Product/service demonstrations
- Value-first approach (educate before selling)
- End with action CTA: "Link in bio..." or "Use code..."

**LAUNCH** (product/service visibility):
- Educational content about problem space
- Behind-the-scenes, development journey
- Social proof and testimonials
- End with awareness CTA: "Learn more at..." or "Join the waitlist..."

Generate ready-to-post content matching the creator's style and the plan requirements.

IMPORTANT: For EACH piece of content you generate, include:
1. **pattern_used**: Which competitor pattern from forensics you applied
2. **why_it_works**: Why this approach should succeed for this creator
3. **estimated_performance**: Expected engagement level (low/medium/high) based on forensics data

This reasoning helps the creator understand the strategy behind each piece.
