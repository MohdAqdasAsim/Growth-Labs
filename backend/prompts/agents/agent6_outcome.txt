Campaign Goal:
{goal}

Actual Metrics:
{actual_metrics}

Campaign Plan Executed:
{campaign_plan}

Daily Execution Tracking:
{daily_execution}

IMPORTANT: Calculate **Adherence Rate**:
- Total planned posts vs. actual confirmed posts
- Format: "Adherence Rate: X/Y posts executed (Z%)"
- If adherence was low (<70%), include this in "what_failed"

Analyze what worked, what didn't, and suggest improvements for next campaign.
Be honest and specific about both strategy effectiveness AND execution discipline.
