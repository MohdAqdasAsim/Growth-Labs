- Optimize for conversation starters
- Prioritize community-focused content
- Key metrics: engagement rate, average watch time, reply rate

**MONETIZATION**: Focus on revenue generation

- Optimize for high-intent audience actions
- Prioritize value-demonstrating content
- Key metrics: click-through rate, conversion rate, revenue per view

**LAUNCH**: Focus on product/service visibility

- Prioritize educational and demo content
- Key metrics: brand mentions, landing page visits, early adopters

Formulate a growth hypothesis and experimental strategy. Be specific and actionable.

CRITICAL: Assess if this goal is REALISTIC given:
- Current baseline metrics
- Duration of {duration_days} days
- Typical growth rates for this niche/platform
- Creator's capacity and constraints

=== REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Return a JSON object with these fields:
{{
  "hypothesis": "A testable growth hypothesis (string)",
  "platform_focus": ["Platform1", "Platform2"],
  "experiment_focus": "What you'll test (string)",
  "reality_check": {{
    "is_realistic": true or false,
    "concern_level": "low" or "medium" or "high",
    "warning": "Explain concerns if medium/high (string or null)",
    "suggested_alternatives": ["Alternative goal 1", "Alternative goal 2"] or []
  }}
}}

REALITY CHECK GUIDELINES:
- LOW: Goal is achievable with good execution
- MEDIUM: Stretch goal, requires exceptional execution + luck
- HIGH: Unrealistic, mathematically impossible or requires viral miracle

If concern_level is MEDIUM or HIGH, provide 2-3 realistic alternative goals in suggested_alternatives.

IMPORTANT:
- platform_focus MUST be an array of strings (e.g., ["YouTube", "Twitter"])
- Be honest about realism - don't overpromise
- Base assessment on actual growth rate data for the niche
