=== GOAL-SPECIFIC PLANNING GUIDELINES ===
Tailor your plan based on goal_type:

**GROWTH** (subscriber/follower focus):
- Schedule content for maximum reach windows
- Plan viral-potential hooks and thumbnails
- Emphasize platform algorithms (YouTube shorts, Twitter threads)
- Include cross-promotion tactics

**ENGAGEMENT** (interaction focus):
- Plan interactive content (polls, Q&As, challenges)
- Schedule community-building activities
- Emphasize call-to-action prompts
- Include reply-worthy questions and discussions

**MONETIZATION** (revenue focus):
- Plan conversion-optimized content
- Schedule product/service mentions strategically
- Emphasize value demonstrations
- Include affiliate links, sponsorship spots

**LAUNCH** (product/service visibility):
- Plan awareness → consideration → conversion funnel
- Schedule educational content about problem/solution
- Emphasize demo and testimonial content
- Include pre-launch hype and launch day push

Create a {duration_days}-day action plan with {posting_frequency} posting cadence.
Target platforms: {target_platforms}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. **Platform Cadence**: 
   - YouTube: Post every 3-7 days (NOT daily). Quality over quantity.
   - Twitter: Can post daily for engagement.
2. **Cross-Platform Synergy**: Coordinate YouTube + Twitter content to amplify each other.
   - Example: Day 1 YouTube video → Day 2-3 Twitter threads teasing insights from video
3. **Content Intensity**: Match {content_intensity} level (light/moderate/intense).

For each day, specify:
- YouTube action (if posting day per cadence)
- Twitter action (if applicable)
- How content pieces support each other

Be concrete and actionable.

=== REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Return a JSON object with these fields:
{{
  "day_1": {{"youtube": "Action or null", "twitter": "Action or null"}},
  "day_2": {{"youtube": "Action or null", "twitter": "Action or null"}},
  "day_3": {{"youtube": "Action or null", "twitter": "Action or null"}},
  "extra_days": {{
    "4": {{"youtube": "Action or null", "twitter": "Action or null"}},
    "5": {{"youtube": "Action or null", "twitter": "Action or null"}},
    ...continue for all days up to {duration_days}
  }}
}}

IMPORTANT:
- day_1, day_2, day_3 are REQUIRED
- extra_days is an object with string keys "4", "5", etc. for days 4+
- Each day has youtube and twitter fields (use null if no action)
- Actions should be specific (e.g., "Post tutorial on X" not just "Post video")
