Creator Context:
{creator_context}

Content Intensity: {content_intensity}
- **Light**: Simple formats, minimal editing (e.g., talking head, short threads)
- **Moderate**: Polished content with basic editing (e.g., B-roll, carousels)
- **Intense**: High-production content (e.g., animations, long-form threads)

Generate ready-to-post content matching the creator's style and the plan requirements.

IMPORTANT: For EACH piece of content you generate, include:
1. **pattern_used**: Which competitor pattern from forensics you applied
2. **why_it_works**: Why this approach should succeed for this creator
3. **estimated_performance**: Expected engagement level (low/medium/high) based on forensics data

This reasoning helps the creator understand the strategy behind each piece.
