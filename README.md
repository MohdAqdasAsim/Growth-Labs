# Growth Labs

**Goal-driven experimentation engine for creator growth**

A lightweight, evidence-based growth assistant that helps content creators run short, focused 3-day experiments to improve performance on YouTube and X through guided hypothesis testing and measurable outcomes.

## Overview

Growth Labs is an experimentation engine designed to help creators test and validate growth strategies quickly. Rather than generating bulk content, it guides you through structured 3-day campaigns that test specific hypotheses about your audience and growth opportunities.

The platform starts with a specific, measurable goal, analyzes your content history and chosen competitors, plans a 3-day micro-campaign, produces daily platform-specific content, and delivers an explainable report showing what worked and what to test next.

## How It Works

### 1. Creator Context Setup

You provide your niche, platforms (YouTube/X), your profile URLs, and a few competitor profiles you admire. The system builds a persistent creator context that informs every future campaign.

### 2. Goal-Based Campaign

Define one concrete goal: gain subscribers, increase engagement, or improve reach. Each campaign is time-bound to 3 days, independent, and tests one clear hypothesis.

### 3. Evidence-Based Strategy

The system forms a growth hypothesis, decides which platform(s) to focus on, and defines measurable success—all based on your data and patterns, not trends.

### 4. Competitor Pattern Analysis

The system analyzes your selected competitors, separating high-performing content from low-performing content, and extracts repeatable patterns including hooks, formats, length, and tone.

### 5. 3-Day Action Plan

A day-by-day plan showing what to post on YouTube and X. You review and approve it before any content is generated.

### 6. Daily Content Execution

Ready-to-post content aligned with your plan, platform-specific scripts, and calls-to-action that match your voice. The focus is on controlled, minimal generation, not bulk posting.

### 7. Outcome Analysis

After 3 days, you enter performance results. The system explains what contributed to gains, what underperformed, and what to test next.

## Key Differentiators

- **Experimentation-Focused**: Rather than content generation, Growth Labs emphasizes structured, measurable learning
- **Goal-Driven**: Every campaign has a defined goal and measurable outcome
- **Data-Grounded**: Strategies are based on your own history and selected competitors, not viral trends
- **Transparent**: All recommendations are transparent and traceable
- **Realistic Timelines**: 3-day sprints provide achievable targets rather than vague, endless promises
